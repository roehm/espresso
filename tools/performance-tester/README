This script measures the amount of time, by which Espresso is slowed down by activating a 
feature at compile time.

Espresso will be compiled twice for each feature to test, once in production mode to measure the time
and once with profiling (-pg) enabled, to obtain profiling info. The results will be saved in FEATURE_NAME.*


Usage:
* Go into an empty directory
* In this directory, make a myconfig-basic.h containing the switches which should always be present. Alternatively use the file from this directory
* In this directory, make a file called featurelist, which contains one feature per line which should be tested. Do not put the #define into the file.. Alternatively, use the file from this directory.
* Copy the lj_liquid_*.tcl from the script directory to the empty directory
* Edit test-features to set the path to your Espresso source
* Run 
  bash test-features
* Afterwards, run 
  bash collect
  to collect the execution times for the different FEATURES. In FEATURE_NAME.prof, you will find profiling information.


Make sure to run the test on a computer which does not have cpu frequency scaling activated.
